# Legacy Armor System
This unfinished datapack makes Minecraft's armor system work like it did in Beta, at least in theory.

Well, it does work! The formula is fully implemented, I just haven't fully mapped it to the armor yet.

## Supported armor configurations
* One of the four pieces of armor, on their own
* The full set
* A Helmet and Boots
* A Helmet and Chestplate (partially)
* Elytra and pumpkins, and other non-armor items being worn are ignored in armor calculations

## What doesn't work
* All armor configurations not listed above

## Untested
* Multiplayer. There have been some fixes but I'm not sure if it works now.
