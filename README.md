# Legacy Armor System

This data pack makes Minecraft's armor system work like it did prior to Beta 1.8. It's a counterpart of sorts to my other data pack, the [Nostalgic Food System](https://github.com/Engielolz/nfs_functions).

It supports Minecraft 1.18 and later, including 1.20.5 with its changes to item data.

It's still a little rough around the edges, but it should be ready for testing.

## Supported armor configurations

* All of them

## What doesn't work

* Hopefully nothing

## To do

* Give all LAS-related objectives a LAS prefix, like NFS Beta 1.2
