# Legacy Armor System
This unfinished datapack makes Minecraft's armor system work like it did in Beta, at least in theory.

Well, it does work! The formula is fully implemented, and everything is mapped to the armor.

It's still a little rough around the edges, but it should be ready for testing.

## Supported armor configurations
* All of them

## What doesn't work
* Hopefully nothing

## To do
* Give all LAS-related objectives a LAS prefix, like NFS Beta 1.2
